# C Programming Coursework

This repository contains C programs I wrote during my Master's coursework at Pondicherry University. These programs span a wide range of fundamental C concepts and are organized by topic for clarity and ease of navigation.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `01_simple_operations/` – Basic input/output, arithmetic operations, simple logic
- `02_if-else/` – Programs using `if`, `else if`, and `else` conditional logic
- `03_switchcase/` – Use of `switch-case` statements for selection control
- `04_loops/` – Programs demonstrating loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- `05_arrays_and_matrices/` – Operations on arrays, multidimensional arrays, and matrices
- `06_functions/` – Programs using user-defined functions and recursion
- `misc/` – Miscellaneous programs that don’t fit the above categories

## 🧪 How to Compile

To compile a `.c` file using `gcc`, use the following command:
```bash
gcc foldername/filename.c -o outputname
./outputname
