# C Programming Coursework

This repository contains C programs I wrote during my Master's coursework at Pondicherry University. These small programs cover a variety of fundamental concepts in C and serve as a record of my learning.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `01_basics/` – Input/output, simple arithmetic, basic syntax
- `02_control_structures/` – If-else, loops, conditionals
- `03_functions/` – Programs using user-defined and recursive functions
- `04_arrays/` – One- and two-dimensional array operations
- `05_math_operations/` – Algebra, geometry, logic-based math problems
- `06_file_operations/` – File input/output
- `07_conversions/` – Unit and value conversions
- `08_string_and_char/` – Character-level and codon-related programs
- `09_statistics_and_logic/` – Logic and statistics-based calculations
- `misc/` – Other programs that don’t fit in the above categories

## 🔧 How to Compile

Use `gcc` to compile any `.c` file. Example:
```bash
gcc 01_basics/hello.c -o hello
./hello
